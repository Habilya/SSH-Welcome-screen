This screen is what the server administrator ever needs. CPU temperature, Load Average, Memory and Disk usage, Available system updates, etc.

The script is **SCRIPT/MOTD.sh**

The installation process is documented at [my blog](https://habilisbest.com/ssh-welcome-screen).

_Note : This was developed for a Raspberry Pi, should work just fine on other debian-based system using bash shell with minor adjustments._

Please contribute.

Cheers!
